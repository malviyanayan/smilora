## My Purpose

This project, **Smilora**, was created purely for learning purposes to improve my front-end web development skills using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

I was inspired by an existing GitHub project called [Dentelo](https://github.com/example/dentelo) and carefully studied it to understand its structure and design. Using that knowledge, I recreated a similar website called Smilora to practice and enhance my skills.  
This project is for personal learning and portfolio purposes only.
